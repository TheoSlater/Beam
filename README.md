# 🚀 Features

## Capture
* 🖥️ **Display, Window, or Custom Crop**
  Record your full screen, a specific app window, or select any area you want to capture.
* 🎙️ **Separate Audio Tracks**
  Capture your microphone and system audio at the same time, each on its own track for easier editing.
* 🎥 **Webcam Overlay**
  Add your camera on top of the recording, move it anywhere on screen, and customize its size and shape.
* 📖 **Floating Teleprompter**
  Keep your script visible while recording with a lightweight transparent teleprompter that stays out of the final capture.

## Editing & Styling
* 🔍 **Smart Zooms**
  Automatically zoom in around clicks and keyboard actions, or add your own zooms with keyframes.
* 🖱️ **Cursor Smoothing & Styling**
  Get clean, fluid cursor movement with native high-precision tracking. Adjust the size, swap the cursor style, add click effects, or smooth out shaky movement.
* 📝 **Local AI Captions**
  Generate subtitles directly on your device using Whisper. No cloud uploads, API keys, or extra subscriptions.
* 🎨 **Canvas Backdrops**
  Give your recordings a polished look with backgrounds, gradients, padding, shadows, and rounded window corners.
* ⏱️ **Multi-Track Timeline**
  Edit video, audio, and subtitles independently with precise scrubbing, snapping, and non-destructive editing.

## Performance & Export
* 🦀 **Rust Capture Engine**
  A lightweight native capture engine built for smooth 60 fps recording without putting unnecessary load on your CPU or GPU.
* 📦 **Direct Export**
  Export straight to MP4 or WebM, up to 4K, with simple bitrate presets and fast rendering.

<details>
<summary><strong>🐧 Linux</strong></summary>

- Distributed as AppImage, DEB, and RPM packages.
- Screen and window capture uses XDG Desktop Portal, PipeWire, and FFmpeg. The system picker requests explicit permission when a capture starts.
- Recording click and keyboard-shortcut metadata requires explicit Polkit consent.
- On X11, overlay positions and sizes can be saved and restored.
- On native Wayland, overlay sizes can be saved, but positions cannot. Wayland prevents applications from reading global window coordinates, so Electron reports `x: 0, y: 0` and Beam cannot restore the camera overlay or teleprompter position.
- Beam does not force XWayland as a workaround because it can be incompatible with some GPU and X11 configurations.
- For experimental development testing, `npm run electron:dev:xwayland` launches Electron with `--ozone-platform=x11`; the normal `npm run electron:dev` path remains native Wayland.
- On native Wayland, use the compositor's window-menu “Always on Top” action on `Beam Overlay`, `Beam Camera Overlay`, or `Beam Teleprompter`; these stable titles can also be used in compositor-specific window rules.
